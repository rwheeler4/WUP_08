```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## make a simple regression model

```{r}
bears <- read.csv(file="BEARS.csv",header = TRUE)
```

## Model LENGTH ~ NECK  this is an example  

```{r}
simp <- lm(LENGTH~NECK,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~NECK,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```

## now predict the length of a bear who has a neck of 17, 22 and 26

```{r}
new <- data.frame(NECK=c(17,22,26))
predict(simp,new)
predict(simp,new,se.fit=TRUE)
```
## Surely there is another variable that can better predict LENGTH than NECK. Find one and compare its performance to that of neck by it value of Adjusted-Rsquared (bigger is better).

### CHEST

```{r}
chesty <- lm(LENGTH~CHEST,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~CHEST,data=bears)
abline(chesty)
summary.lm(chesty)
```

The adjusted r-squared fo this model (CHEST) is .79; the model for NECK had an adjusted R-squared of .75. 
So far, the best model is the one based on the CHEST measurements.

```{r}
new <- data.frame(CHEST=c(17,22,26))
predict(chesty,new)
predict(chesty,new,se.fit=TRUE)
```


### WEIGHT


```{r}
weighty <- lm(LENGTH~WEIGHT,data=bears)

So far, the best model is the one based on the CHEST measurements.

```{r}
new <- data.frame(WEIGHT=c(17,22,26))
predict(weighty,new)
predict(weighty,new,se.fit=TRUE)
```


### LENGTH


```{r}
